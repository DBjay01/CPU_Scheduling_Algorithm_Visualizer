# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualization

## Live : https://schedsim.netlify.app/


## Description

This project provides a visualization tool for comparing the performance of various CPU scheduling algorithms. It includes functionalities to display Gantt charts, timeline charts, and performance comparison charts. The focus is on comparing metrics like completion time, turn around time, waiting time, response time, and context switches across different algorithms and time quantums.

## Features

- Line chart visualization for Round Robin scheduling with varying time quantums
- Bar chart comparison of different CPU scheduling algorithms
- Detailed visualizations of Gantt charts, timeline charts, and time logs

## Prerequisites

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chart.js library
